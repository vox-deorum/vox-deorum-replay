/**
 * save-parser.ts
 * Parser for Civilization V (Vox Populi) save game files
 * Saves do not embed a finished replay, they embed the raw ingredients: the
 * event log inside the game section, and one replay data cluster per player
 * slot. This parser extracts those, rebuilds the civilization list from the
 * uncompressed pregame section, and assembles the same data shape the
 * replay parser produces so the rest of the application cannot tell the
 * difference.
 *
 * Beyond the replay content, the parser reads the save-only snapshot data
 * that sits at known offsets: the victory result from the game section
 * prelude, the map header (wrap flags and map-wide counts) in front of the
 * plot records, and the per plot snapshot fields (owner, resource,
 * improvement, route, city flag, owning city) inside each plot record.
 *
 * Layout of a save, top to bottom:
 * - An uncompressed engine header (shared front half with replay files)
 * - The uncompressed CvPreGame section (slot setup and game options)
 * - An 8 byte compression marker, then one zlib stream to end of file
 * - Inside the stream: the game section (with the event log early on and the
 *   embedded SQLite database at its end), the map section right after the
 *   database, then one section per player slot in slot order
